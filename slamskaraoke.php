                        <p>Slamâ€™s Karaoke is a family run business. We operate in the Redlands and started out two years ago 2016 after being frustrated at the lack of decent options for karaoke equipment for our regular family parties. As a group of family friends we all took turns and rented a lot of jukeboxes and karaoke systems throughout the Brisbane area, all of them were serviceable and we enjoyed them very much. But after the parties we kept wondering what was missing from the experience.</p>
